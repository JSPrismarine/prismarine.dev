Howdy all you wonderful people!
As you may know, one of the biggest problems with open source projects is finding contributors, even the larger projects like PocketMine is having this exact issue.

To solve this we've gone ahead and started trying a platform called [IssueHunt](https://issuehunt.io/r/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine) which is an open source bounty service.
That basically means that we'll (and other people) will be able contribute money towards specific GitHub issues/milestones.

We have also decided that all our Patreon money *in excess what we pay for domain(s) and hosting* will go towards this (if you haven't already you should definitely [become a Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/prismarine), it comes with it's own Discord badge.. oh sooo shiny).


So, if you're a node developer wanting to make a bit extra on the side while also helping contributing to JSPrismarine make sure to check out the [GitHub issues tagged with "Funded on IssueHunt"](https://github.com/JSPrismarine/JSPrismarine/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22%3Adollar%3A+Funded+on+Issuehunt%22).

Till next time, keep on diggin'
